# Domain Objects

Contains all the info on objecs in the game.

This is where we store the representations of all the objects in the game, cities, players, rogues, cards, etc.

These objects should never refer to display parts of the game (ie screens or level) to prevent import loops.

## Appendix

In programming, domain objects are classes, structs, or data types that represent concepts from the "problem domain" (the real-world area your program is modeling).

They encapsulate data and behavior directly related to those concepts.
