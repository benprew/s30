1.  **Separate Rules Logic from Core Engine (Rules Engine Pattern)**
    * Adopt the **Rules Engine Design Pattern**. This involves separating the core game mechanics (turn phases, mana system, combat) from the logic specific to individual cards.
    * **Core Engine**: Handles fundamental game processes: turn structure (untap, upkeep, draw, main phases, combat, end step), mana pool management, stack management (resolving spells and abilities last-in, first-out), combat sequence (declaring attackers/blockers, assigning damage, first strike, trample), and basic game state tracking (life totals, library, hand, graveyard, battlefield).
    * **Rules Collection**: This is where individual card logic resides. Each card's unique effects, abilities, and interactions are defined here, separate from the core engine code.

2.  **Data-Driven Card Representation**
    * Define static card attributes in data files (e.g., JSON, XML, database). This includes:
        * Name, Mana Cost, Color
        * Card Type (Creature, Instant, Sorcery, Enchantment, Artifact, Land)
        * Subtypes (e.g., Human, Soldier, Aura, Wall)
        * Power/Toughness (for creatures)
        * Static abilities (keywords like Flying, First Strike, Trample, Protection, Banding, Defender)

3.  **Scripting for Dynamic Abilities and Effects**
    * For complex, dynamic abilities (activated abilities, triggered abilities, spell effects), use a scripting approach. Each card (or ability) would have an associated script or definition that the core engine can execute.
    * **Examples**:
        * `Prodigal Sorcerer`: Script for the ": This creature deals 1 damage to any target" ability.
        * `Animate Dead`: Script handling its complex enter-the-battlefield effect, attaching to a creature card in a graveyard, returning it, becoming an Aura enchanting that creature, and the sacrifice trigger when it leaves.
        * `Swords to Plowshares`: Script to exile a target creature and make its controller gain life equal to its power.
        * `Wrath of God`: Script to destroy all creatures and prevent regeneration.
    * This allows you to add new cards by primarily writing new data entries and scripts, without constantly modifying the core engine.

4.  **Implement an Event/Trigger System**
    * Design the core engine to emit events for significant game actions (e.g., `phase_begins`, `card_drawn`, `spell_cast`, `creature_enters_battlefield`, `damage_dealt`, `card_tapped`).
    * Card scripts can then "listen" or subscribe to these events to implement triggered abilities (e.g., "When [event], do [effect]"). This maps well to the "Trigger Conditions" and "Actions" concepts in the rules engine pattern.

5.  **Isolate the Rules Engine**
    * Keep the rules engine completely separate from the User Interface (UI) or graphics engine. The rules engine should manage the game state and enforce all rules. The UI should only visualize the state provided by the engine and send player actions (like choosing targets or activating abilities) back to the engine for validation and execution.

**Benefits of this Approach:**

* **Extensibility**: Adding new cards primarily involves adding data and scripts, minimizing changes to the core, tested engine code.
* **Maintainability**: Rules are localized to specific card scripts, making them easier to debug and modify.
* **Testability**: The core engine and individual card scripts can be tested more easily in isolation.
* **Clear Separation of Concerns**: Game mechanics, card logic, and presentation are distinct.

You might also find it helpful to look at existing open-source Magic: The Gathering engines like Forge or XMage for inspiration on how they handle specific rules and card implementations. Frameworks like boardgame.io or specific engine tools like CardHouse (Unity) or Godot Car
d Game Framework might also offer relevant concepts.
