* TODO Duel/Ante Screen
Initial version will allow player to bride or "play game". If play game is chosen, randomly determine winner and give wins/losses.

- [X] Clean up Rogue/Enemy refactor
- [X] Implement bribes (static 20 gold)
- [X] Implement duel (75% chance of winning, win 3 cards or lose ante)
- [ ] show winning screen
- [ ] show losing screen
- [X] Give player starting deck
- [ ] Add enemy "level" to .toml files (determines life and bribe cost) [[https://mtg.wiki/page/Magic%3A_The_Gathering_%28MicroProse%29_Preconstructed_Decks?utm_source=chatgpt.com][wiki-src]]
  - [[how much ][list of characters]]
- [ ] Add color for each enemy (to choose background)
  - or do it at runtime by counting cards/mana symbols
* TODO Edit deck screen
- [ ] Show cards
- [ ] Sell cards
- [ ] Add Decks to player, including active deck
* TODO player decks/card collections
- [ ] constraints on a player's deck
  - should only allow cards in a player's collection (can check when adding a card to a deck)
  - selling a card/losing a card to ante should remove the card from the card collection and all player decks
* [X] Make more enemies appear and move randomly
Every 30 ticks if a player hasn't interacted with an enemy in the last 100 ticks spawn a new enemy.

Also, make the enemies have a little movement jitter towards the player instead of running directly at the player. Also, make the enemies occasionally stop and wait until the player gets closer and then run towards them.

* Storing Large files/images?
Should I store card art in the repo?
- No, this bloats the repo. Instead have tools to download images from scryfall as needed.

Options:
- Store individual card art on a server in the format and compression I want. Make http requests when loading art.
  - Con: Now I'm responsible for keeping carddart up or the game breaks.
  - Con: Could make calls to scryfall directly, but again it requires some server to stay running and a way to get card URLs
- Store full zip files.
  - Could be in embed.FS
    - Con: 2GB file limit for binaries
    - Con: large filesize makes download slow
  - Could be distributed with game, like .WAD files for doom/quake
    - Pro: people can distribute their own .zip files with their mods for custom card lists
    - Con: Doesn't work with web version, there is no .zip file to reference

* Card Art
Image art should be 190x150
card back images are 228 x 325

Would also require text for:
- mana cost
- set symbol
- card text
- flavor text


I've opted out of writing a cat decoder since I can get card art online: https://scryfall.com/docs/api/images

** Sizes
Medart.cat is 31MB

That's 300 cards at 100k/card, which seems possible.
- burgeoning.jpg is 160k
- burgeoning-art.jpg is 130k

Try converting them to .png and running:
- pngquant --quality=60-80

Example art image for burgeoning, size is 190x140

-rw-r--r--  1 ben ben  59K Jul 23 23:19  c16-143-burgeoning-art.png
-rw-rw-r--  1 ben ben  25K Jul 23 23:20  c16-143-burgeoning-art-fs8.png

stripped down is 25k! That's pretty good! For all 25k cards, that's only 625MB

For 1k cards that's only 25MB, much better than Medart! It could be even better if I could separate the palette from the image, but .png doesn't support that and ChatGPT doesn't give me any good standard image formats that do this.

Google suggest GIF format, LZW compressed and can have separate palette

Also look into AVIF format (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVIF)

*** Resizing images:
# Resize to specific width, height auto-calculated
convert input.png -resize 300x output.png

# Resize to specific height, width auto-calculated
convert input.png -resize x200 output.png

# Resize to fit within 300x200 box (won't exceed either dimension)
convert input.png -resize 300x200 output.png

# Resize by percentage
convert input.png -resize 50% output.png
* Storing cards
Can use MTG Oracle ID for card id, and keep updated with scryfall

- images: https://scryfall.com/docs/api/images
- cards.json: https://scryfall.com/docs/api/bulk-data

* Adding transparency to an image
Converted buttons that had black background to transparent background:

convert assets/art/sprites/city/Smbuybttn.png -transparent black assets/art/sprites/city/Smbuybttn.png

* Scaling the game screen
Note: why does web version scale up?

Some options for handling scaling

## 1. **Percentage-Based Positioning**
Instead of hardcoded pixel positions, use percentages of screen dimensions:

```go
// Instead of:
buttonX := 100
buttonY := 50

// Use:
buttonX := int(float64(screenW) * 0.1)  // 10% from left
buttonY := int(float64(screenH) * 0.065) // 6.5% from top
```

## 2. **Anchor-Based Layout System**
Create an anchor system for UI elements:

```go
type Anchor int
const (
    TopLeft Anchor = iota
    TopCenter
    TopRight
    CenterLeft
    Center
    CenterRight
    BottomLeft
    BottomCenter
    BottomRight
)

type UIElement struct {
    Anchor Anchor
    OffsetX, OffsetY int  // Offset from anchor point
}

func (ui *UIElement) GetPosition(screenW, screenH int) (int, int) {
    switch ui.Anchor {
    case TopLeft:
        return ui.OffsetX, ui.OffsetY
    case TopCenter:
        return screenW/2 + ui.OffsetX, ui.OffsetY
    case Center:
        return screenW/2 + ui.OffsetX, screenH/2 + ui.OffsetY
    // ... other cases
    }
}
```

## 3. **Responsive Layout Manager**
Create a layout manager that handles different screen sizes:

```go
type LayoutManager struct {
    baseWidth, baseHeight int  // Your original 1024x768
}

func (lm *LayoutManager) ScalePosition(x, y, currentW, currentH int) (int, int) {
    scaleX := float64(currentW) / float64(lm.baseWidth)
    scaleY := float64(currentH) / float64(lm.baseHeight)

    return int(float64(x) * scaleX), int(float64(y) * scaleY)
}
```

## 4. **Constraint-Based Layout**
Define relationships between UI elements:

```go
type Constraint struct {
    Element    *UIElement
    RelativeTo *UIElement  // nil for screen edges
    Spacing    int
    Direction  Direction   // Above, Below, LeftOf, RightOf
}
```

## 5. **Grid System**
Divide the screen into a grid and position elements within grid cells:

```go
type GridLayout struct {
    Rows, Cols int
}

func (g *GridLayout) GetCellPosition(row, col, screenW, screenH int) (int, int) {
    cellW := screenW / g.Cols
    cellH := screenH / g.Rows
    return col * cellW, row * cellH
}
```

## **Recommended Approach for Your Game:**

Given your current setup, I'd suggest starting with **option #2 (Anchor-Based)** combined with **option #3 (Layout Manager)**:

1. **Modify your Button struct** to include anchor information
2. **Update your screen classes** (CityScreen, BuyCardsScreen, etc.) to use anchored positioning
3. **Create a helper function** that converts your current hardcoded positions to anchored ones

This approach:
- Requires minimal changes to existing code
- Provides good flexibility for different screen sizes
- Is easy to understand and maintain
- Works well with your existing UI element structure

Would you like me to show you how to implement the anchor-based system for your specific button and UI setup?

architect> /ask I'd like some abstract representation of pixels that I can use so that I don't have to pass scale around everywhere, what would that look like? and what are the shortcomings of that approach?

Here's an abstract pixel representation approach:

## **Virtual Pixel System**

```go
// Virtual pixel unit - always represents the same logical size
type VPixel int
type VPoint struct {
    X, Y VPixel
}
type VRect struct {
    X, Y, W, H VPixel
}

// Global viewport that handles conversion
type Viewport struct {
    baseWidth, baseHeight int     // Your reference resolution (1024x768)
    currentWidth, currentHeight int
    scale float64
}

var GlobalViewport *Viewport

func (vp *Viewport) ToScreen(v VPixel) int {
    return int(float64(v) * vp.scale)
}

func (vp *Viewport) ToScreenPoint(p VPoint) (int, int) {
    return vp.ToScreen(p.X), vp.ToScreen(p.Y)
}

func (vp *Viewport) FromScreen(pixels int) VPixel {
    return VPixel(float64(pixels) / vp.scale)
}

func (vp *Viewport) UpdateScale(newWidth, newHeight int) {
    vp.currentWidth = newWidth
    vp.currentHeight = newHeight
    vp.scale = math.Min(
        float64(newWidth)/float64(vp.baseWidth),
        float64(newHeight)/float64(vp.baseHeight),
    )
}
```

## **Usage Example**

```go
// Instead of:
buttonX := 100
buttonY := 50

// Use:
buttonPos := VPoint{X: 100, Y: 50}

// In your draw function:
screenX, screenY := GlobalViewport.ToScreenPoint(buttonPos)
drawButton(screen, screenX, screenY)
```

## **Integration with Your Button System**

```go
type Button struct {
    // ... existing fields
    Position VPoint  // Instead of X, Y int
    Size     VPoint  // Instead of separate width/height
}

func (b *Button) Draw(screen *ebiten.Image) {
    x, y := GlobalViewport.ToScreenPoint(b.Position)
    w, h := GlobalViewport.ToScreenPoint(b.Size)

    opts := &ebiten.DrawImageOptions{}
    opts.GeoM.Scale(GlobalViewport.scale, GlobalViewport.scale)
    opts.GeoM.Translate(float64(x), float64(y))
    screen.DrawImage(b.Normal, opts)
}
```

## **Shortcomings of This Approach**

### **1. Global State Dependency**
- Creates coupling between all UI code and the global viewport
- Makes testing harder (need to initialize global state)
- Can cause issues in multi-threaded scenarios

### **2. Type Safety Issues**
- Easy to accidentally mix VPixel and regular int values
- Compiler won't catch when you forget to convert
- Can lead to subtle bugs when values get passed around

### **3. Performance Overhead**
- Every pixel access requires a multiplication
- Frequent conversions can add up, especially for complex UI
- Cache misses from extra indirection

### **4. Debugging Complexity**
- Harder to debug layout issues (need to convert values mentally)
- Print statements show virtual pixels, not actual screen positions
- Tools/debuggers show actual pixels, creating disconnect

### **5. Third-Party Library Integration**
- Ebiten and other libraries expect real pixels
- Need conversion at every boundary
- Easy to forget conversions when using library functions

### **6. Precision Loss**
- Repeated conversions can accumulate floating-point errors
- Small VPixel values might round to 0 at small scales
- Can cause alignment issues with fractional scaling

## **Alternative: Context-Based Approach**

```go
type RenderContext struct {
    scale float64
    screenW, screenH int
}

func (rc *RenderContext) ScaleX(x int) int {
    return int(float64(x) * rc.scale)
}

// Pass context explicitly instead of global state
func (b *Button) Draw(screen *ebiten.Image, ctx *RenderContext) {
    x := ctx.ScaleX(b.X)
    y := ctx.ScaleY(b.Y)
    // ...
}
```

This avoids global state but requires passing the context around, which you wanted to avoid.

## **Recommendation**

For your game, I'd suggest a **hybrid approach**:
- Use the virtual pixel system for **UI layout and positioning**
- Keep the global viewport for convenience
- Add helper methods to your existing structs to handle conversion
- Use real pixels for performance-critical rendering code

This gives you the convenience without the full overhead everywhere.
