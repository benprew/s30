Let's break down the tasks for the first phase: **Terrain Rendering**. Here’s an organized list to get started:

### **Phase 1: Terrain Rendering**

#### **1. Generate the World**
- **Task 1.1**: Set up a basic noise-based system (Perlin or Simplex Noise) to generate the terrain.
- **Task 1.2**: Apply thresholds to the noise map to assign terrain types (mountains, marshes, forests, etc.).
- **Task 1.3**: Ensure smooth transitions between terrain types using noise features (e.g., no abrupt changes).

#### **2. Save and Load the World Data**
- **Task 2.1**: Create a system for saving and loading the world data (just terrain types) in JSON format.
- **Task 2.2**: Implement file I/O to store and retrieve the world data.
- **Task 2.3**: Ensure that the data for the terrain is loaded and saved properly, including chunk-based handling.

#### **3. Chunk System**
- **Task 3.1**: Divide the world into 10x10 tile chunks.
- **Task 3.2**: Implement basic chunk loading/unloading based on the player’s position.
- **Task 3.3**: Ensure seamless transition between loaded and unloaded chunks to avoid flickering.

#### **4. Terrain Rendering**
- **Task 4.1**: Render the terrain tiles based on the generated world data and chunk system.
- **Task 4.2**: Draw tiles using the appropriate tile set for each terrain type (mountains, marshes, etc.).
- **Task 4.3**: Ensure that tiles are rendered without flickering, handling chunk loading/unloading smoothly.
  
#### **5. Camera Setup**
- **Task 5.1**: Implement a camera system that stays centered on the player’s position.
- **Task 5.2**: Ensure the camera is properly synced with the terrain and only renders the currently loaded chunks.

#### **6. Edge of World Handling**
- **Task 6.1**: Set up a system where the player’s movement is blocked by deep water at the edge of the map.
- **Task 6.2**: Ensure that there’s no way for the player to pass through the deep water or move off the island.

### **Additional Considerations**
- **Performance Optimization**: Monitor performance as chunks are loaded/unloaded, especially with larger world sizes.
- **Tile Set Setup**: Verify that the tile set matches the intended look for each terrain type (mountain, forest, etc.).
- **Testing**: Test chunk loading/unloading, world generation, and camera behavior to ensure everything works smoothly.
